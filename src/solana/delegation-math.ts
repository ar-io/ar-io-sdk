/**
 * Delegation balance math.
 *
 * On-chain, `Delegation.amount` is the last-settled principal. Pending rewards
 * are tracked separately via the gateway's per-share accumulator
 * (`Gateway.cumulative_reward_per_token`) and the delegate's snapshot of that
 * accumulator at the last settlement (`Delegation.reward_debt`). The
 * `distribute_epoch` instruction advances the accumulator but does NOT touch
 * per-`Delegation.amount` — that field is updated lazily on the next
 * delegation interaction (or via the permissionless
 * `compound_delegation_rewards` instruction).
 *
 * Off-chain readers (indexers, wallets, the network portal) that want to show
 * a delegate's current balance must therefore compute the live value from the
 * accumulator + reward_debt; reading `Delegation.amount` directly under-reports
 * every epoch of pending rewards.
 *
 * This module mirrors the on-chain `settle_delegate_rewards` math from
 * `programs/ario-gar/src/state/mod.rs` so the SDK can return live values from
 * its read-side methods (`getGatewayDelegates`, `getDelegations`,
 * `getAllDelegates`) without needing an on-chain settlement call.
 *
 * See `INVARIANTS.md` in the contracts repo for the broader stake-pool
 * invariant context.
