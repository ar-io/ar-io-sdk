/**
 * Reclaim rent from the ephemeral Address Lookup Tables `signer` created for
 * prescribe (see {@link sendWithEphemeralLookupTable}). Each prescribe leaves a
 * single-use table allocated (~0.0126 SOL of rent); reclaiming needs a
 * deactivate → ~513-slot cooldown → close sequence, so it can't run inline — a
 * throttled permissionless cleanup pass (cranker / observer) calls this.
 *
 * Discovery is RPC-portable. `getProgramAccounts` on the Address Lookup Table
 * program is rejected by Agave RPCs (`Invalid param: WrongSize`, on public
 * devnet/mainnet-beta and dedicated providers alike — the ALT program can't be
 * enumerated), so instead we read the signer's own transaction history
 * (`getSignaturesForAddress` + `getTransaction`) and collect the tables it
 * referenced via `message.addressTableLookups` — a prescribe ALT is used in
 * exactly one transaction.
 *
 * Safety fingerprint: a candidate is only touched when EVERY one of its entries
 * is owned by a program in `allowedEntryOwners` (the GAR + ArNS programs — i.e.
 * observer Gateway PDAs + the ArNS NameRegistry). That composition uniquely
 * identifies a prescribe ephemeral, so the pass never deactivates/closes an
 * unrelated table even if `signer` is also used to author Address Lookup Tables
 * for other purposes.
 *
 * DEACTIVATES still-active matches (starts the cooldown) and CLOSES deactivated
 * matches past the cooldown (refunding rent to `signer`). At most `maxTables`
 * submissions per call; scans at most `scanLimit` recent signatures. Best-effort:
 * per-table failures are skipped and retried on the next pass.
